The ybt package contains functions that facilitated the writing of the 2018 and 2019 Yolo Bypass Project Telemetry Reports for the California Department of Water Resources.

This package and the functions in it should be considered read-only, as it is no longer under active development. It is provided for reproducibility and reference.
